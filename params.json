{"name":"SafeGuard 2: Electric Boogaloo","tagline":"A reboot of the classic, featuring innovative multi-threaded detection systems, server calibration, and much, much more!","body":"# Welcome to the project page for SafeGuard 2: Electric Boogaloo\r\nThe long awaited reboot/sequel is finally here. Finally, an anti-cheat plugin that is centered around reduction of illegal gameplay while still being considerate of maintaining vanilla gameplay. What does that mean? We, much like you, hate false positives. So we'll do our darndest to keep the rascals out.\r\n\r\n## Development Gameplan\r\n\r\n### Get a stable Alpha out\r\nBy that, I mean map out the framework for the plugin, and get a working example out, complete with bare-bones checks that are considered highest in priorities in terms of a security standpoint.\r\n\r\n### Combat Feature Creep\r\nWhile I will fix issues and add in new features, I won't go out of my way to add in 1x10^45 different things. I'll work in fixes for the most commonly used \"hacks\", and make those as rock solid as possible.\r\n\r\n### Move to Beta\r\nWoot! Now it's time to start adding those teeny tiny patches in. Don't want players using AutoFish? Now's the time and place I'll be fixing it. Ahh, isn't Beta so sweet? (Maybe I'll even work on an API for people to add their own patches in; wouldn't that be fun?)\r\n\r\n### Release\r\nBy this point in time the plugin should be at a mature stage. As Minecraft and Bukkit grow and evolve, I'll constantly be updating it to keep current, and will routinely go in and patch all of the latest crazes of bypasses and hacks. This point is an indeterminate amount of time away; depending on my life/popularity/need for/of the plugin, it may never see the light of a true release. I am hopeful though.\r\n\r\n## Now, how can I participate in the development of SG2? Here's how!\r\n\r\n* Download and install the plugin\r\n* Report any issues to the reports page over at BukkitDev, or go to https://github.com/m1enkrafftman/SafeGuard2/issues and create a new issue report. I'll get to it in order of development priorities and do my best to fix it.\r\n* Enjoy the fruits of my labor. Seriously. I do this out of the good of my heart, and I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Want to follow along in the development process?\r\nThe GitHub page is located [here](https://github.com/m1enkrafftman/SafeGuard2).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Feature List\r\n\r\n| Name           |  Description |\r\n|--------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Movement Speed    | Disables people from using any speed-based movement hacks.
